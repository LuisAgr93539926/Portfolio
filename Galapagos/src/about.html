      <h2>About the author</h2>
      <p>Hi my name is Luis Mario and I am a Seneca College student, I created this lovely websites to try and seduce people into put Galapagos Islands in their bucket list! It should be noted that I am actually from Ecuador, where the islands are at. I have been around 3 times in my entire life and I still can't get over them if I am being honest. If you are a nature-lover you should consider Galapagos as your next travel destination. I created this whole website by myself and I really put some effort to exceed the requirements because I am really interested in created websites and I even before starting Seneca got a udemy certificate of attending a Javascript course. </p>
