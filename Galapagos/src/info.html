        <h2>History</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Galapagos Islands have a rich history of exploration, with their
          first recorded discovery by the Spanish in 1535.
        </li>
        <li>
          They served as a popular stopover for pirates and whalers during the
          17th and 18th centuries.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 19th century, Charles Darwin visited the islands aboard the HMS
          Beagle and his observations here greatly influenced his theory of
          evolution.

        <div class="back"><p>
          Costs vary depending on the season and how luxurious you want it to be, the activities you want to do, your travel style and many more factors, however it still affordable for the budget traveler. The most expensive
          expense will be the ticket itself which, because it depends from where you are travelling from we will skip the ticket price. However once you are in Galapagos,there are activities that range from free to around $100USD-$150USD. Accommodations depend on your preferences, but you can find hostels for around $30USD-$40USD per night. Meals also depend on the restaurant or places you want to go, but it will range from $10USD to $30USD per meal for mid-range dining options. Transportation is really cheap where you can get taxis for $5 to $20 per ride. It should be emphasized that, because Galapagos is home to a lot of endemic creatures the government enforces a lot of strict policies to keep the city clean and natural. So in order to enter the Galapagos National Park there is a $100USD fee per person. It should also be noted that, depending on the month, season, duration of the trip, prices may change and this is a rough estimate without include the airplane flight itself.</p></div>
