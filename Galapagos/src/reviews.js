      "Galapagos islands has a special place in my heart. It's such a unique place on earth. Seeing so many animals in such a small area is unique. Seals, penguins, sharks, crabs, birds, turtles etc. Amazing place and don't forget the story of Charles Darwin. Treat the place with respect! Don't ever touch animals and don't get to close to them.",
