# My Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio as an aspiring software developer. I have created a personal website that features my skills, projects, and contact details. The project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while emphasizing the importance of a clean, user-friendly design and efficient code.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: I've designed the website to be responsive, ensuring that it functions seamlessly across different device sizes from mobile to desktop. This was made possible through the application of CSS Flexbox and media queries.
